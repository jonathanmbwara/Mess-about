            Know When to Apply In general, you should exfoliate your face only
            twice per week. For best results, exfoliate after you've used a face
            wash and rinsed thoroughly with warm water. You can use a daily
            facial cleanser which is appropriate for both morning and nighttime
            face washing.

          <li>
            Dispense the Proper Amount With your face thoroughly rinsed and
            still wet, dispense a nickel-sized amount of exfoliating scrub into
            the palm of your hand. Be sure to use no more than this amount as
            our products are concentrated and go a long way.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread Evenly Over Hands Before applying the product to your face,
            rub both hands together gently to spread the scrub to your other
            hand. This allows for a more even application.
